One example: grid was key to creating the faux file folder on the portfolio page.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ka9lr4">Essentially, I have an SVG for each tab‚Äîjust the tab part, not the rectangular folder body. Why? I expect the file folder to resize frequently, whether due to different screen sizes, or whether certain rows are filtered. The rectangular folder body for each tab is just a <code>div</code>, designed to be easily resized by its grid container. I also had the tab label text (‚Äùdesign‚Äù and ‚Äúwriting‚Äù).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-tu5xnc">Here‚Äôs how I put everything together using grid.

I first found a Svelte alternative, <code>svelte-icons-pack</code>, but for some reason many of the Ionicons icons were either filled incorrectly or did not display at all. I thought Ionicons looked pretty good (and I had designed with them), so I then proceeded to try every other way of using Ionicons. On Christmas Day. I read every tutorial, Stack Overflow post, and GitHub issue until someone mentioned that Ionicons just had some compatibility issues with Svelte üò≠ Eventually, I migrated to Feather Icons (and tried every other way again). I came crawling back to <code>svelte-icons-pack</code>, which seemed to work perfectly fine with Feather Icons. Moral of the story: <code>svelte-icons-pack</code> is probably the easiest way to use icons in Svelte, and just don‚Äôt use Ionicons.

Trying to get any sort of image placeholder (solid color, low-resolution blur) was a total pain. Ultimately, I think there‚Äôs just much more I have to learn about images in web development. Most of the solutions that I could find relied on specifying a width and height for the image, which makes sense because the placeholder needs a width and height in order to take up space and reduce cumulative layout shift. However, I wanted my images to resize dynamically to fit the size of its container. Maybe I just need to create a million sizes of the image with <code>srcset</code>? I‚Äôm not sure how Gatsby and Next.js do it, but I would love to learn.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-uegxyc">Here were some of the resources that I looked at and tried to use: <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/building-an-awesome-image-loading-experience" rel="nofollow">Kent C. Dodd‚Äôs blog post</a>, <a href="https://rodneylab.com/sveltekit-image-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Rodney Lab‚Äôs SvelteKit Image Plugin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash" rel="nofollow">blurhash</a>. They‚Äôre still great resources! In the meantime, I‚Äôm just using <code>vite-imagetools</code> to resize my images and convert them to WebP. Maybe someday I‚Äôll attempt to save the masses by making a <code>sveltekit-image</code> if SvelteKit doesn‚Äôt man up and do it soon.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-qtnfwe">Newsletters</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-2u8ze0">I‚Äôd narrowed it down to three main options: Substack, Revue, and Buttondown. Substack and Revue are both huge in the newsletter world, while Buttondown is a small (but really cool!) service. Any one of these services would have worked wonderfully, save for one aspect: the subscription email embed. With Substack, a styled embed isn‚Äôt even in the picture because Substack has a closed API. Scott Spence outlines this solution for a styled email form with <a href="https://scottspence.com/posts/email-form-submission-with-sveltekit" rel="nofollow">Revue</a>, which has an open API, but it seemed to be a very significant amount of work. On the other hand, Buttondown provided the HTML for the email form so that I could style it to my heart‚Äôs content.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-96mo81">This <em>would</em> have been rather dandy, but I realized that whenever the form was submitted, the page would redirect to Buttondown‚Äôs page. This was automatic‚Äîthe redirect was forced, and you could only change the redirect destination from the Buttondown dashboard. It would be extremely disorienting for the viewer to be thrown to another site, and then have to navigate back toward <a href="https://scottspence.com/posts/email-form-submission-with-sveltekit" rel="nofollow">vivianwli.com</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fy1d7s"><strong>The (somewhat) jank solution?</strong> I chose <a href="http://vivianwli.com/blog" rel="nofollow">vivianwli.com/blog</a> as my redirect link. Even then, the navigation would kick the user to the top of the page. To make this seem more natural, I used <code>svelte-toast</code> to create an ‚ÄúEmail submitted!‚Äù toast. I changed the Buttondown redirect link to <a href="http://vivianwli.com/blog?emailSubmitted=true" rel="nofollow">vivianwli.com/blog?emailSubmitted=true</a>, and then ran toast when the <code>emailSubmitted</code> parameter was true.

I wanted to use it for a pseudo-slideshow animation, but the <code>proximity</code> distance is determined by the browser. You can‚Äôt choose how close the scroll must be before it snaps. I‚Äôm still using it on the home page (for tiny re-orientations), but it really doesn‚Äôt do much. In this case, it‚Äôs a simple but very limited tool.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-16ajep3">Where images go</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-158hq8c">I switched the location of my images folder several times while building the website. I was very confused about this, but I have an answer for you! In order for it to work in both dev mode and build mode, you have two options:</p> <ul><li><code data-svelte-h="svelte-uk9qxq">static</code>: Svelte can‚Äôt do dynamic imports, (a la <code data-svelte-h="svelte-1bwfiqe">src={picture1}</code> where <code data-svelte-h="svelte-1qit19t">picture1</code> is your file name). If you‚Äôre trying to display images where its path would be a variable (my <code data-svelte-h="svelte-1wg4jd7">BlogCard.svelte</code> and <code data-svelte-h="svelte-khtlth">ArticleCard.svelte</code>), put it in static. You can‚Äôt access <code data-svelte-h="svelte-1fkgjes">src</code> at build time!
<ul><li><code data-svelte-h="svelte-1fkgjes">src</code> (I did <code data-svelte-h="svelte-11nu5xa">src/$lib/assets</code>): this is great for when you know exactly which images you need (the home page, the portfolio, my blog posts). You can import and use it like this:
${validate_component(HighlightSvelte, "HighlightSvelte").$$render($$result, { code: code1 }, {}, {})}
This way, you can do some responsive stuff, like loading smaller images via \`vite-imagetools\`.
${validate_component(HighlightSvelte, "HighlightSvelte").$$render($$result, { code: code2 }, {}, {})}</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1c6egmt">#justiOSthings</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-b2c6on">Chrome DevTools has a great option for responsive design, allowing developers to emulate different screen sizes and ensure that it looks great. However, because it‚Äôs just an emulator, my designs came out looking a bit wonky on iPhone at first. My heading text wasn‚Äôt italicized, my portfolio images were horrendously stretched (just really blurry colors), and my email form looked like this:</p> ${validate_component(BlogGallery, "BlogGallery").$$render($$result, { columns: "2", className: "half-width" }, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `${validate_component(BlogImage, "BlogImage").$$render(

        },
        {},
        {}
      )}`;
    }
  })} <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mlzwge">So if DevTools doesn‚Äôt work, what does? If you have a Mac and an iPhone, you can enable Inspect Element on your iPhone and then connect to your computer. If not, tough luck. However BroswerStack offers ten-minute trials to test on an actual iPhone. Although the time seems ridiculously short, it actually really helped! Just a bit of fiddling in DevTools got me where I wanted.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-dvx6ve">Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-97g8v7">The first time I experienced this in dev mode, it was terrifying. My background orbs were black, my text was in Times New Roman, everything was in the wrong place. Scenes out of a horror movie. This goes away at build time, but I was also experiencing this ‚Äúflash of partially-styled content‚Äù in production as well. Everything would be the right color, but the layout was still off and the margins didn‚Äôt kick in until a second later. I dealt with it for a while, but I ultimately fixed this issue by moving some of the relevant styles from <code>__layout.svelte</code> into <code>app.scss</code>. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is because <code>app.html</code> is used in every page and saturated with the Svelte content, so the styles from <code>app.scss</code> are put in place first before the rest of the page finishes loading.
