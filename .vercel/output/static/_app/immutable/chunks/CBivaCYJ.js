Some were well-acquainted with Netlify’s interface, while others had only tried to deploy a site once or twice.

Many of the pages presented <strong>too much information without clear hierarchy</strong>, and provided <strong>too much action autonomy</strong>.",z,k,se="Design approach",S,C,ae="The name of the game is differentiation. I mapped out the typical user journey below: developers start by clicking to view a certain production or preview deploy, or clicking to view all deploys of a certain type.

The screens looked so similar that they were often mistaken for each other, and yet they misleadingly appreared to be distinct pages despite just being loaded in different states. As echoed by the user interviews, users often felt like they were running circles in a maze.

Since nearly all Netlify users share the same goals and key actions, we want to give the user as few options and steps as possible.
